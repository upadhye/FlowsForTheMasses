Non-linear multi-flow cosmological perturbation theory for massive neutrinos, 
described in Chen, Upadhye, and Wong, https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16020 .

FlowsForTheMasses version 1.0

================================================================================

Installation:

FlowsForTheMasses relies on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), available at 
https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ .  Once this has been installed, edit the 
PATHS variable in Makefile to include the locations of the GSL headers and 
libraries.  Then compile FlowsForTheMasses using 'make' from the command prompt.

Parallelization in FlowsForTheMasses uses OpenMP.  The code may be compiled 
without parallelization by deleting the "-fopenmp" flag in the Makefile.

================================================================================

Running:

FlowsForTheMasses is run directly from the command prompt.  It requires:

  1.  an input parameter file listing the cosmological parameters and 
      code inputs, as detailed in the comments to the example file
      sample_params_FlowsForTheMasses.dat , and passed as an argument; 

  2.  a transfer function at redshift 0, in the standard 13-column format 
      produced by the CAMB code (https://camb.info), and named as specified
      in the parameter file.

A parameter file sample_params_FlowsForTheMasses.dat and the corresponding CAMB 
transfer function file nu05_transfer_z0.dat are included with the code.  Note
that parameters must appear in the order specified in this sample parameter
file; lines beginning with a pound character (#) are ignored by the code.

A bash shell script runAll has been provided for generating input parameter 
files for CAMB and FlowsForTheMasses, then running both.  Variables beginning 
USER_ are specified by the user in the user-defined parameter section.

Note that older versions of CAMB, as well as CLASS with the format=camb option,
produce 7-column transfer files.  FlowsForTheMasses will accept these if 
switch_transfer_type is set to 1 in the parameter file.

================================================================================

Printing results:

FlowsForTheMasses outputs are governed by switch_print in the parameter file.
Values 0, 1, 2, and 3 refer, respectively, to the functions print_all_growth ,
print_all_Pcblin_Pcbnl_Pnutot , print_all_Pmono , and print_all in the file
AU_cosmofunc.h and produce the following outputs:

  0: print_all_growth prints the CDM+baryon growth factor D, its logarithic 
     derivative f = dln(D)/dln(a), and the total neutrino density monopole;

  1: print_all_Pcblin_Pcbnl_Pnutot prints the linear CDM+baryon power, the 
     non-linear CDM+baryon power, and the total neutrino monopole power; 

  2: print_all_Pmono prints linear CDM+baryon power, the non-linear CDM+baryon 
     power, and the neutrino power for each fluid individually;

  3: print_all prints all Legendre moments of all neutrino perturbations and 
     bispectrum integrals, followed by the linear and non-linear CDM+baryon 
     perturbations and the Time-RG bispectrum integrals.

================================================================================

Setting the numbers of flows and angular modes:

FlowsForTheMasses bins the distribution function into N_TAU equal-density flows,
each characterized by a single momentum magnitude tau.  Dependence upon the 
angle between the momentum and the Fourier vector is expanded in N_MU Legendre 
moments.  Both N_TAU and N_MU are specified at compile time through preprocessor
#define statements in AU_cosmoparam.h .

Since the computational cost of non-linear neutrino mode-coupling integrals
scales as the sixth power of the number of angular modes, FlowsForTheMasses 
allows the number of modes passed to these integrals to be set separately
at runtime through switch_Nmunl in the parameter file.

================================================================================

Stability threshold kThr:

As detailed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16020 , increasing switch_Nmunl leads
to increasingly severe numerical instabilities.  When such instabilities cause
FlowsForTheMasses to reduce the step size below the minimum PARAM_DETA_MIN 
specified in FlowsForTheMasses.cc , the code discards the highest k value and
resumes integration.  The stability threshold kThr is the maximum k value for
which integration continues.  Each time the derivative function der is called
with kThr less than the maximum wave number KMAX it prints the kThr value.
Behavior of the neutrino perturbations for k > kThr is ill-defined and 
discontinuous.  

================================================================================

Tuning code performance:

The number NK of k values, and their minimum KMIN and maximum KMAX , are 
specified in AU_fftgrid.h .  Since increasing NK worsens noise and exacerbates
the numerical instabilities above, we recommend not raising NK much above 128.

FlowsForTheMasses.cc contains several parameters, switches, and functions to 
tune the code's performance:

  PARAM_DETA0 is the default starting step size in eta = ln(a/a_in);

  PARAM_DETA_MIN is the minimum step size in eta;

  PARAM_EABS and PARAM_EREL are the absolute and relative error tolerance;

  PARAM_D2NU_NL specifies the value of the dimensionless power spectrum 
    k^3/(2*pi^2) P_{alpha}(k) at which to begin computing non-linear corrections
    for neutrino flow alpha;

  SWITCH_VERBOSITY ranges from 0-3 and specifies the verbosity of the code;

  NZREC specifies the maximum number of redshift values at which to recompute 
    the neutrino non-linear mode-coupling integrals;

  f_A_nu(double k) smoothly suppresses the neutrino non-linear mode-coupling
    integrals for k below k_A_lo and above k_A_hi .  

================================================================================

Examples:

Sample run scripts and CAMB/FlowsForTheMasses parameter files are provided for 
several LambdaCDM runs with fixed parameters h = 0.6766, n_s = 0.9665, 
A_s = 2.135e-9, Omega_{m,0}h^2 = 0.14175, and Omega_{b,0}h^2 = 0.02242, with 
only Omega_{nu,0}h^2 varying.

  nu05 (Omega_{nu,0}h^2=0.005), switch_Nmunl=3:  This is the minimal recommended
    value of switch_Nmunl.  The code runs without needing to reduce kThr due
    to numerical instabilities.

  nu05 (Omega_{nu,0}h^2=0.005), switch_Nmunl=3, switch_print=3:  Inputs are
    similar to the above except that the full set of perturbations is printed 
    out at z of 200 and 0.  Included gnuplot scripts (called as arguments to 
    gnuplot) plot monopole (j=0) power spectra for all flows alpha, and alpha=0
    power spectra for all j.  Also included are pdf figures produced using these
    two gnuplot scripts. 

  nu05 (Omega_{nu,0}h^2=0.005), switch_Nmunl=4:  Instabilities force the
    reduction of kThr to 5.30163 h/Mpc, after which the code reaches z=0.

  nu05 (Omega_{nu,0}h^2=0.005), switch_Nmunl=5:  Due to low-k noise, we have
    raised k_A_lo to 0.05 h/Mpc.  Instabilities reduce kThr to 4.42251 h/Mpc.

  nu05 (Omega_{nu,0}h^2=0.005), switch_Nmunl=6:  Due to low-k noise, we have
    raised k_A_lo to 0.05 h/Mpc.  Instabilities reduce kThr to 4.03924 h/Mpc.

  nu02 (Omega_{nu,0}h^2=0.002), switch_Nmunl=3:  The code runs to z=0 without
    needing to lower kThr.
